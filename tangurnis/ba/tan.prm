# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------

# At the top, state that the program should be run for a two-dimensional 
# simulation
set Dimension = 2


# In computations, the time step $k$ is chosen according to $k = c \min_K
# \frac{h_K}{\|u\|_{\infty,K} p_T}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of cell $K$,
# and the denominator is the maximal magnitude of the velocity on cell $K$
# times the polynomial degree $p_T$ of the temperature discretization. The
# dimensionless constant $c$ is called the CFL number in this program. For
# time discretizations that have explicit components, $c$ must be less than a
# constant that depends on the details of the time discretization and that is
# no larger than one. On the other hand, for implicit discretizations such as
# the one chosen here, one can choose the time step as large as one wants (in
# particular, one can choose $c>1$) though a CFL number significantly larger
# than one will yield rather diffusive solutions. Units: None.
set CFL number                             = 1.0

# The end time of the simulation. Units: years if the 'Use years in output
# instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.
set End time                               = 0.0001

set Nonlinear solver scheme                = Stokes only

# The name of the directory into which all output files should be placed. This
# may be an absolute or a relative path.
set Output directory                       = output

# A flag indicating whether the computation should be resumed from a
# previously saved state (if true) or start from scratch (if false).
set Resume computation                     = false

# The start time of the simulation. Units: years if the 'Use years in output
# instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.
set Start time                             = 0

# In order to make the problem in the first time step easier to solve, we need
# a reasonable guess for the temperature and pressure. To obtain it, we use an
# adiabatic pressure and temperature field. This parameter describes what the
# `adiabatic' temperature would be at the surface of the domain (i.e. at depth
# zero). Note that this value need not coincide with the boundary condition
# posed at this point. Rather, the boundary condition may differ significantly
# from the adiabatic value, and then typically induce a thermal boundary
# layer.
# For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the
# general mathematical model.
set Adiabatic surface temperature          = 0

# The mathematical equations that describe thermal convection only determine
# the pressure up to an arbitrary constant. On the other hand, for comparison
# and for looking up material parameters it is important that the pressure be
# normalized somehow. We do this by enforcing a particular average pressure
# value at the surface of the domain, where the geometry model determines
# where the surface is. This parameter describes what this average surface
# pressure value is supposed to be. By default, it is set to zero, but one may
# want to choose a different value for example for simulating only the volume
# of the mantle below the lithosphere, in which case the surface pressure
# should be the lithostatic pressure at the bottom of the lithosphere.
# For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the
# general mathematical model.
set Surface pressure                       = 0

# When computing results for mantle convection simulations, it is often
# difficult to judge the order of magnitude of results when they are stated in
# MKS units involving seconds. Rather, some kinds of results such as
# velocities are often stated in terms of meters per year (or, sometimes,
# centimeters per year). On the other hand, for non-dimensional computations,
# one wants results in their natural unit system as used inside the code. If
# this flag is set to 'true' conversion to years happens; if it is 'false', no
# such conversion happens.
set Use years in output instead of seconds = false  # default: true

  #
  # `spherical gaussian perturbation': An initial temperature field in which

  subsection Visualization
    # VTU file output supports grouping files from several CPUs into one file
    # using MPI I/O when writing on a parallel filesystem. Select 0 for no
