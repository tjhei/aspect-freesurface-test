Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.

average temperature/... depending on depth (for use in material model and output)

Topics for an ASPECT II paper:

- Compressibility
- Nonlinearity
- Checkpoint/restart
- Mesh refinement criteria:
  - for density, which is not continuous, Kelly does not make sense
  - use gradient norm approximation in each cell
  - right h scaling needed, because error does not converge, >1, but small as possible
  - h^(1+d/2) okay?
- How implicit to be?


Immediate TODOs:
----------------
- in Parameters, rename TemperatureContribution etc to refinement_temperature_method
  or similar. make run-time parameters lower-case in the .prm file
-



Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- Refinement criterion in 3d? rescale to the average, not to the max
- Use extrapolated solution for grid refinement
- Attach a proper license and adjust headers of all files
- Go through the list of TODOs in the source code and see what can be done
- minimal mesh size (shortest edge divided by order)
- make initial conditions class say whether it implements a temperature
  or a temperature perturbation
- name the material model better than "table" and put the input files into
  a better directory
- re-write the geometry section since information on the boundary components
  is no longer there
- describe in the manual how to set boundary conditions
- allow for arbitrary tangential boundary conditions (via Eh Tan, e.g. from
  gplates)
- add an easter egg
- sort the member functions in the various material model classes in the
  same way. mark them as virtual if that's what they actually are
- make the default for parameters.include_shear_heating true after
  testing that the model works correctly
- provide an option to store not only the last snapshot but many
- move the adiabatic heating term (the last one in the temperature equation)
  to the left hand side and make it implicit


- Create a task list for a release that includes:
  . create a branch
  . update the version number on the front page of doc/manual.pdf
  . remove the various table_* postprocessors
  . update doc/manual/parameters.tex by running aspect-2d with an empty .prm
    file and copying output/parameters.tex to doc/manual/parameters.tex
  . run
      cd doc ; make manual.pdf
    unfortunately, this will yield a number of errors related to underscores
    in parameters.tex that have to be resolved manually at this time
  . check in doc/manual.pdf
  . make sure the .prm and .xml files we ship match the default values
    of parameters
  . create a tar file
  . upload tar file
  . link in on download.html
  . announce on
       cig@geodynamics.org
       aspect-devel@geodynamics.org
       cig-mc@geodynamics.org

First release
