This file is our internal working list of things to do in the near future
=========================================================================


Create list of publications. Include
- papers
- AGU 2011 poster
- AGU 2012 poster: 2x Eric
- Eric's XSEDE poster:
     Investigating Mixing and Flow in the Earth's Mantle using Adaptive Mesh
     Finite Element Simulations
  Heien, Bangerth, Heister, Kellogg



Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- unify readme.html in aspect/ and from the webpage again
- make run-time parameters lower-case in the .prm file
- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- Refinement criterion in 3d? rescale to the average, not to the max
- Use extrapolated solution for grid refinement
- minimal mesh size (shortest edge divided by order)
- make initial conditions class say whether it implements a temperature
  or a temperature perturbation
- name the material model better than "table"
- re-write the geometry section since information on the boundary components
  is no longer there
- describe in the manual how to set boundary conditions
- allow for arbitrary tangential boundary conditions (via Eh Tan, e.g. from
  gplates)
- add an easter egg
- make the default for parameters.include_shear_heating true after
  testing that the model works correctly
- provide an option to store not only the last snapshot but many
- move the adiabatic heating term (the last one in the temperature equation)
  to the left hand side and make it implicit
- methods to compute dynamic topography from the dynamic part of the pressure


- Create a task list for a release that includes:
  *** go over the installation section again and make sure the cmake stuff
      is in there and correct ***

  . go through the list of TODOs in the source code and see what can be done
  . make sure the description of the interfaces that need to be updated
    are up to date in the manual
  . update copyright years of all files
  . update changes.h in doc/modules:
    1. svn cp changes.h <oldversion>-<newversion>.h
    2. remove entries from changes.h
    3. update headers of both files
    4. svn commit
  . create a branch:
    svn cp https://svn.aspect.dealii.org/trunk/aspect https://svn.aspect.dealii.org/branches/releases/aspect-0.2
  . remove TODO on the branch
  . update the version number on the front page of doc/manual.pdf (and also on trunk!)
  . remove the various table_* postprocessors
  . update doc/manual/parameters.tex by running aspect with doc/manual/empty.prm
    and copying output/parameters.tex to doc/manual/parameters.tex
    and fix things like "tecplot_binary"->"tecplot\_binary"
  . run
      cd doc ; make manual.pdf
  . check in doc/manual.pdf
  . make sure the .prm and .xml files we ship match the default values
    of parameters
  . create a tar file (do svn export): 
    tar --exclude-vcs -czf aspect-0.3.tar.gz aspect-0.3/
  . upload tar file (deal homepage svn in aspect/download)
  . link in on download.html (same location)
  . announce on
       cig-all@geodynamics.org
       aspect-devel@geodynamics.org
       cig-mc@geodynamics.org
       cig-cs@geodynamics.org
       dealii@googlegroups.com

Announcement for 0.2:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                    http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release adds a significant number of new features, including:
   - support for active and passive "compositional" fields (courtesy of
     Juliane Dannberg)
   - more flexibility to output only some variables, drastically reducing
     the amount of data written
   - support for user-defined mesh refinement criteria
   - support for GPlates-generated velocity boundary conditions (courtesy
     of Rene Gassmoeller)
   - support for passive tracer particles
   - provision of an "introspection" module as part of the source code
     to make it easier and less error-prone to write extension code
In addition, the manual has been significantly expanded, with many new
cookbooks, and we have fixed a number of bugs. A list of changes is
available here:

First release
-------------
- Nonlinearity
- Real 3d
- Better 3d coarse mesh?
- Participate in Shijie's benchmarking effort, see email of 12/16/2011

For later (from the Berkeley discussion, 9/26/2012)
---------------------------------------------------
- compositional fields or tracers (John Naliboff and Eric Heien have
  		       	  	   initial tracers; Juliane Dannberg
				   is working on fields)
- rheology and nonlinear iteration
- free surfaces (Ian Rose has something initial)
- self gravity (Ian Rose has something initial)
- compressibility
- prescribed heat flux

- document variable velocity boundary conditions

- improve compositional tracking:
  . if a field is binary 0/1, use a higher order entropy viscosity
  . if several fields together sum to one, do something else




tests for the various refinement criteria
fix regression in cookbooks/composition-active in r1370
write a testcase for friction heating (Poiseulle flow) and
  adiabatic heating (constant downward velocity)
write a postprocessor that shows temperature minus depth averaged
  temperature. maybe similar for density (= buoyancy)


- change some/all material models to the new system


write tests for the depth averaging functions (test adaptive refinement,
averaged composition, non-zero average/sinking velocity)
  
write tests to verify the possibility of external plugins compiled into
shared libraries. implement ways to verify that they are compiled against
the same version of ASPECT that they are running under.
