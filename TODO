Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.



Topics for an ASPECT II paper:

- Compressibility
- Nonlinearity
- Checkpoint/restart
- Mesh refinement criteria
- How implicit to be?




Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- Implicit time stepping
- Clean-up
- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- temperature equation also must contain phase-change heating terms (see the paper
  in doc/papers)
- look at parameterization of geometry and initial temperature field
- Documentation. talk about
     . reference step-31, 32, paper
     . physical units: MKS throughout, but output sometimes in cm/year, also some input parameters
     . extensibility through plugin-concept in models
- Refinement criterion in 3d?
- Attach a proper license and adjust headers of all files

First release
-------------
- Nonlinearity
- Real 3d
- Better mesh?
