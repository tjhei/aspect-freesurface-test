Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.



Topics for an ASPECT II paper:

- Compressibility
- Nonlinearity
- Checkpoint/restart
- Mesh refinement criteria
- How implicit to be?




Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- temperature equation also must contain phase-change heating terms (see the paper
  in doc/papers)
- readme.html
- front page of doxygen documentation
- Refinement criterion in 3d?
- Attach a proper license and adjust headers of all files
- Go through the list of TODOs in the source code and see what can be done

First release
-------------
- Nonlinearity
- Real 3d
- Better mesh?
