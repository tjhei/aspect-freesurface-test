This file is our internal working list of things to do in the near future
=========================================================================


Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.

average temperature/... depending on depth (for use in material model and output)


Create list of publications. Include
- papers
- AGU 2011 poster
- Eric's XSEDE poster:
     Investigating Mixing and Flow in the Earth's Mantle using Adaptive Mesh
     Finite Element Simulations
  Heien, Bangerth, Heister, Kellogg



Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- unify readme.html in aspect/ and from the webpage again
- make run-time parameters lower-case in the .prm file
- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- Refinement criterion in 3d? rescale to the average, not to the max
- Use extrapolated solution for grid refinement
- minimal mesh size (shortest edge divided by order)
- make initial conditions class say whether it implements a temperature
  or a temperature perturbation
- name the material model better than "table"
- re-write the geometry section since information on the boundary components
  is no longer there
- describe in the manual how to set boundary conditions
- allow for arbitrary tangential boundary conditions (via Eh Tan, e.g. from
  gplates)
- add an easter egg
- make the default for parameters.include_shear_heating true after
  testing that the model works correctly
- provide an option to store not only the last snapshot but many
- move the adiabatic heating term (the last one in the temperature equation)
  to the left hand side and make it implicit
- methods to compute dynamic topography from the dynamic part of the pressure


- Create a task list for a release that includes:
  . go through the list of TODOs in the source code and see what can be done
  . make sure the description of the interfaces that need to be updated
    are up to date in the manual
  . create a branch
  . remove TODO on the branch
  . update the version number on the front page of doc/manual.pdf
  . remove the various table_* postprocessors
  . update doc/manual/parameters.tex by running aspect-2d with an empty .prm
    file and copying output/parameters.tex to doc/manual/parameters.tex
  . run
      cd doc ; make manual.pdf
    unfortunately, this will yield a number of errors related to underscores
    in parameters.tex that have to be resolved manually at this time
  . check in doc/manual.pdf
  . make sure the .prm and .xml files we ship match the default values
    of parameters
  . create a tar file
  . upload tar file
  . link in on download.html
  . announce on
       cig@geodynamics.org
       aspect-devel@geodynamics.org
       cig-mc@geodynamics.org
       cig-cs@geodynamics.org
       dealii@dealii.org


First release
-------------
- Nonlinearity
- Real 3d
- Better 3d coarse mesh?
- Participate in Shijie's benchmarking effort, see email of 12/16/2011

For later (from the Berkeley discussion, 9/26/2012)
---------------------------------------------------
- compositional fields or tracers (John Naliboff and Eric Heien have
  		       	  	   initial tracers; Juliane Dannberg
				   is working on fields)
- rheology and nonlinear iteration
- free surfaces (Ian Rose has something initial)
- self gravity (Ian Rose has something initial)
- compressibility
- prescribed heat flux

- document variable velocity boundary conditions

- improve compositional tracking:
  . if a field is binary 0/1, use a higher order entropy viscosity
  . if several fields together sum to one, do something else




tests for the various refinement criteria
fix regression in cookbooks/composition-active in r1370
write a testcase for friction heating (Poiseulle flow) and
  adiabatic heating (constant downward velocity)
write a postprocessor that shows temperature minus depth averaged
  temperature. maybe similar for density (= buoyancy)




write tests for the termination modules
improve the handling of termination criteria in core.cc:1200
