Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.

average temperature/... depending on depth (for use in material model and output)

Topics for an ASPECT II paper:

- Compressibility
- Nonlinearity
- Checkpoint/restart
- Mesh refinement criteria:
  - for density, which is not continuous, Kelly does not make sense
  - use gradient norm approximation in each cell
  - right h scaling needed, because error does not converge, >1, but small as possible
  - h^(1+d/2) okay?
- How implicit to be?


Immediate TODOs:
----------------
- in Parameters, rename TemperatureContribution etc to refinement_temperature_method
  or similar. make run-time parameters lower-case in the .prm file
-



Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- add strain rate to viscosity() function, to be future compatible
- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- Refinement criterion in 3d? rescale to the average, not to the max
- Use extrapolated solution for grid refinement
- Attach a proper license and adjust headers of all files
- Go through the list of TODOs in the source code and see what can be done
- minimal mesh size (shortest edge divided by order)
- make initial conditions class say whether it implements a temperature
  or a temperature perturbation
- name the material model better than "table" and put the input files into
  a better directory
- re-write the geometry section since information on the boundary components
  is no longer there
- describe in the manual how to set boundary conditions
- allow for arbitrary tangential boundary conditions (via Eh Tan, e.g. from
  gplates)
- describe in geometry model descriptions what boundary indicators they have
- the heat flux computation is very sensitive to the number of processors.
  values may change by a factor of 5 between 1 and 2 processors. what's going
  on?
- add an easter egg


- Create a task list for a release that includes:
  . update doc/manual/parameters.tex
  . update and check in doc/manual.pdf
  . make sure the .prm and .xml files we ship match the default values
    of parameters


First release
-------------
- Nonlinearity
- Real 3d
- Better 3d coarse mesh?
- Participate in Shijie's benchmarking effort, see email of 12/16/2011
