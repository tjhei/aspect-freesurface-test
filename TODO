Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.



Topics for an ASPECT II paper:

- Compressibility
- Nonlinearity
- Checkpoint/restart
- Mesh refinement criteria
- How implicit to be?




Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- temperature equation also must contain phase-change heating terms (see the paper
  in doc/papers)
- readme.html
- front page of doxygen documentation
- Refinement criterion in 3d?
- Use extrapolated solution for grid refinement
- Attach a proper license and adjust headers of all files
- Go through the list of TODOs in the source code and see what can be done
- Allow different output formats in the visualization plugin

- Create a task list for a release that includes:
  . update doc/manual/parameters.tex
  . update and check in doc/manual.pdf
  . make sure the .prm and .xml files we ship match the default values
    of parameters


First release
-------------
- Nonlinearity
- Real 3d
- Better 3d coarse mesh?
