# Like 'no_adiabatic_heating_02' but here we actually switch on friction
# heating and set the viscosity to a non-zero. In this testcase, we have
#   u_z(z) = 1+z/100
# so in 2d, we have
#   eps(u) - 1/3 (div u) I = [[-1/300,0], [0,2/300]]
# so the friction heating term is
#   2*eta*5/9*(1/100)^2
# Consequently, if we set the thermal diffusivity to zero, then from
#   DT/Dt = 2*eta*5/9*(1/100)^2
# we get
#   T(t)  = 2*eta*5/9*(1/100)^2 * t + T(0)
# From the velocity, we get
#   z = t*t^2/200
# so
#   T(z)  = 2*eta*5/9*(1/100)^2 * (10*sqrt(100+2z)-100) + T(0)
# Thus, the maximal temperature at the outlet should be
#   T(1)  = 2*eta*5/9*(1/100)^2 * (10*sqrt(102)-100) + T(0)
# To make all of this work, of course, we need that the density does
# not depend on the temperature
#
# In this testcase, we choose eta=10, so this should lead to
#   T(1)  = 0.001105
