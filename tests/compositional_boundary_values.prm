# A testcase that evaluates inflow boundary conditions for compositional
# fields. It solves the equations on a box with Dirichlet boundary conditions
# equal to (z,0), which then is also the velocity everywhere.
#
# We prescribe boundary values for the compositional fields at the left
# and see how it is transported towards the right.
