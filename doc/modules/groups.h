/**
 * @defgroup Simulator The main class implementing the mantle convection
 * problem
 *
 * This group contains the primary class implementing the mantle convection
 * problem as well as other things that may be directly related to it.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Postprocessing Postprocessing solutions
 *
 * This group contains all classes, namespaces and functions that have to do
 * with postprocessing the solution of the simulation at the end of each time
 * step. This includes generating graphical output, computing integrals, or
 * other statistics.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup MaterialModels Describing the properties of the fluid
 *
 * This group contains all classes, namespaces and functions that have to do
 * with modeling the fluid under consideration. This includes handling all
 * input parameters related to the material, as well as describing how
 * density, viscosity, and many other parameters depend on pressure,
 * temperature, and/or position within the fluid.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup GeometryModels Describing the properties of the domain
 *
 * A module for the definition of properties of the geometry. This primarily
 * includes the definition of the shape of the domain (e.g. whether it is a
 * full spherical shell, a quadrant/octant, a description of the geoid, etc.
 * The classes and functions of this module also describe which kinds of
 * boundary conditions hold on the different parts of the boundary of the
 * geometry.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup GravityModels Describing the properties of the gravity
 *
 * A module for the definition of gravity. Gravity is described as a class
 * that provides a function that returns the gravity vector direction and
 * magnitude as a function of location. The module also contains the various
 * functions necessary to add different gravity models that can then be
 * selected in the input file.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup InitialConditionsModels Describing initial conditions
 *
 * A module for the definition of functions and classes that have to do with
 * initial conditions for the temperature and, if necessary, other quantities.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup BoundaryTemperatures Describing temperature boundary conditions
 *
 * A module for the definition of functions and classes that have to do with
 * describing boundary values for the temperature.
