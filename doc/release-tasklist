- Create a task list for a release that includes:
  . go through the list of TODOs in the source code and see what can be done
  . make sure the description of the interfaces that need to be updated
    are up to date in the manual
  . fix doxygen errors:
    find include -name "*h" -print | xargs -n 1 deal-trunk/tests/scripts/checkdoxygen.py
  . fix formatting:
    find . -name "*h" -print | while read file;do deal.II/contrib/utilities/wrapcomments.py $file >temp;mv temp $file;done
  . apply astyle formatting, see doc/astyle.rc
  . update copyright years of all files
  . update changes.h in doc/modules:
    1. svn cp changes.h <oldversion>-<newversion>.h
    2. remove entries from changes.h
    3. update headers of both files
    4. svn commit
  . create a branch:
    svn cp https://svn.aspect.dealii.org/trunk/aspect https://svn.aspect.dealii.org/branches/releases/aspect-0.2
  . remove TODO on the branch
  . update the version number on the front page of doc/manual.pdf (and also on trunk!)
  . remove the various table_* postprocessors
  . update doc/manual/parameters.tex by "cd doc;./update_parameters.sh"
  . run
      cd doc ; make manual.pdf
  . check in doc/manual.pdf
  . make sure the .prm and .xml files we ship match the default values
    of parameters
  . create a tar file (do svn export): 
    tar --exclude-vcs -czf aspect-0.3.tar.gz aspect-0.3/
  . upload tar file (deal homepage svn in aspect/download)
  . link in on download.html (same location)
  . announce on

Announcement for 0.2:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                    http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release adds a significant number of new features, including:
   - support for active and passive "compositional" fields (courtesy of
     Juliane Dannberg)
   - more flexibility to output only some variables, drastically reducing
     the amount of data written
   - support for user-defined mesh refinement criteria
   - support for GPlates-generated velocity boundary conditions (courtesy
     of Rene Gassmoeller)
   - support for passive tracer particles
   - provision of an "introspection" module as part of the source code
     to make it easier and less error-prone to write extension code
In addition, the manual has been significantly expanded, with many new
cookbooks, and we have fixed a number of bugs. A list of changes is
available here:
