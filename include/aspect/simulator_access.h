   * SimulatorAccess is base class for different plugins like postprocessors. It provides access to

   * in their evaluations, such as solution vectors, the current time, time step
   * sizes, material models, or the triangulations and DoFHandlers that correspond to solutions.
   *
   * This class is the interface between plugins and the main simulator
   * class. Using this insulation layer, the plugins need not know anything
   * about the internal details of the simulation class.
   *
   * Every Postprocessor is required to derive from SimulatorAccess. It is optional
   * for other plugins like MaterialModel, GravityModel, etc..
   *
   * Since the functions providing access to details of the simulator class
   * are meant to be used only by derived classes of this class (rather
   * than becoming part of the public interface of these classes), the
   * functions of this class are made @p protected.
