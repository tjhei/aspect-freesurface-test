   * corresponding vector and scalar FEValues extractors, component
   * masks, etc.
   *
   * The purpose of this class is primarily to provide these symbolic
   * names so that we do not have to use implicit knowledge about the
   * ordering of variables (e.g., earlier versions of ASPECT had
   * many places where we built a scalar FEValues extractor at
   * component 'dim' since that is where we knew that the pressure
   * lies in the finite element; this kind of implicit knowledge is
   * no longer necessary with the Introspection class). The Introspection
   * class is used both by the Simulator class itself, but is also
   * exported to plugins via the SimulatorAccess class.
