       * to query if a coefficient, here the viscosity, depends on the temperature,

       * for efficiency, these functions may also be called with a combination of
       * flags, for example as in
       * @code
       *   material_model.viscosity_depends_on (temperature | strain_rate);
       * @endcode
       * where the operation in passing the argument concatenates the two
       * values by performing a bitwise 'or' operation. Because the values of
       * the enum are chosen so that they represent single bits in an integer, the
       * result here is a number that can be represented in base-2 as 101 (the
       * number 100=4 for the strain rate and 001=1 for the temperature). The
       * functions taking such arguments are required to return <code>true</code>
       * whenever the coefficient represented by this function depends on <i>any</i>
       * of the variables identified in the argument.
       *
       * To query nonlinear dependence of a coefficient on any other variable,
       * you can use
       * @code
       *   material_model.viscosity_depends_on (any_variable);
       * @endcode
       * Here, <code>any_variable</code> is a value that has its bits set for

       * only a single variable may be identified in a variable of this type since
